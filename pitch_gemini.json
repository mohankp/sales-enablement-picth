  "common_objections": {
    "It's too expensive": "I completely understand that budget is a primary concern. However, rather than looking at the upfront sticker price, I'd invite you to consider the Total Cost of Ownership; Python's concise syntax and massive library ecosystem significantly reduce development time and maintenance costs compared to other languages. Let's schedule a brief call to customize a package that maximizes value within your current budget constraints.",
    "We're already using [competitor]": "That makes sense, and [competitor] certainly has its place in the market. We aren't necessarily asking you to rip and replace your entire stack; Python is highly interoperable and serves as the industry standard for Data Science and AI, areas where [competitor] may lag behind. Can we discuss a small pilot project to demonstrate how Python can augment your existing infrastructure?",
    "We don't have time to implement something new": "I hear you, and bandwidth is always a challenge for engineering teams. The advantage of Python is that it is famously easy to read and learn\u2014often described as 'executable pseudocode'\u2014which drastically shortens the onboarding curve compared to other technologies. If you can spare 15 minutes, I can walk you through a migration roadmap that minimizes disruption while accelerating your future delivery speed.",
    "We need to think about it": "Of course, these are big decisions and shouldn't be rushed. Usually, when teams need to deliberate, it's to determine how this aligns with long-term technical debt reduction or hiring strategies. I'll send over a few case studies relevant to your industry to help with your evaluation\u2014would it be okay if I checked back in with you early next week?",
    "Can you prove the ROI?": "That is a great question, and we believe the results should speak for themselves. Beyond just code efficiency, Python.org solutions offer ROI through faster time-to-market and access to the world's largest talent pool of developers, reducing recruitment costs. I'd love to share a breakdown of how similar companies improved their deployment velocity by 40% after switching\u2014when would be a good time to review those numbers?"
