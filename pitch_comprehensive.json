  "common_objections": {
    "It's too expensive": "I completely understand that budget is a top priority, and it's crucial to evaluate any new expense carefully. Many of our clients initially felt the same way, but they often find that the cost of *not* having an automated system\u2014in terms of payroll errors, compliance risks, and administrative hours\u2014is actually much higher. ADP SecurTime is designed to be an investment that pays for itself by reducing costly errors and freeing up valuable time. Could we spend 15 minutes mapping out your current process? I'm confident we can identify specific areas where SecurTime would generate significant savings for you.",
    "We're already using a competitor": "That's great that you already have a system in place; it shows you value efficient workforce management. We often speak with companies using other providers who are looking to solve challenges their current system can't, particularly around seamless payroll integration and reducing manual workarounds. ADP SecurTime is unique because it's part of a single, unified ecosystem, eliminating data-syncing errors and simplifying compliance. Would you be open to a brief 20-minute comparison call next week? We can pinpoint the key differences and see if there's a compelling reason to explore a change.",
    "We don't have time to implement something new": "I completely understand. The idea of a new implementation on top of your daily workload can feel overwhelming. That's precisely why our process is designed to be managed *for* you, not *by* you. We provide a dedicated implementation team that handles the technical setup, data migration, and training. The short-term time investment is designed to give you back countless hours in the long run by automating the manual tasks that are likely consuming your team's time right now. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call with one of our implementation specialists to walk you through the process? There's no commitment, but it will show you just how light the lift is on your end.",
    "We need to think about it": "Of course, it's a significant decision and deserves careful consideration. To make sure I've given you everything you need for that review, could you share what's on your mind? Often when people say they need to think about it, it's about either the budget, the timing, or the specific features. Knowing your main focus will help me provide the most relevant information. How about I send a follow-up email summarizing our conversation and including a case study from a similar company? We can then schedule a brief check-in for next week to answer any new questions that come up.",
    "Can you prove the ROI?": "That's the most important question, and I'm glad you asked. We absolutely can. The ROI for SecurTime is typically driven by three main areas: reducing payroll leakage from inaccuracies and unauthorized overtime, recovering administrative hours spent on manual tasks, and mitigating compliance risks. Based on data from clients your size, we typically see a full return on investment within 6 to 9 months. The best way to see this for yourself is to build a custom business case. Would you be open to a brief 20-minute call where we can use our ROI calculator with your specific numbers to project your potential savings?"
