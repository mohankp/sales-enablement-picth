  "common_objections": {
    "It's too expensive": "I understand that budget is a top priority. Most of our clients look at ADP SecurTime not as a cost, but as an investment that pays for itself. By automating manual tasks and eliminating common errors like incorrect overtime calculations, businesses typically see a 2-5% reduction in payroll costs. Would you be open to a 15-minute call where we can use our ROI calculator with your numbers to project your specific savings?",
    "We're already using a competitor": "That's great you already have a system in place; it shows you value efficient workforce management. What we often hear from businesses who switch from [competitor] is that they're seeking a more seamlessly integrated solution. Because SecurTime is built into the ADP ecosystem, it eliminates manual data transfers between time tracking and payroll, which saves time and prevents costly errors. I'm not asking you to switch today, but would you be open to a brief demo to see how that integration could benefit your team?",
    "We don't have time to implement something new": "I hear that a lot. The idea of a new implementation can feel overwhelming when you're already busy. That's why we pair you with a dedicated implementation specialist who manages the heavy lifting, from data migration to setup. The goal is a short-term time investment that frees up hours of administrative work every week for the long term. Could I share a sample implementation plan? It shows just how much of the process we handle for you.",
    "We need to think about it": "Of course, that's completely understandable. It\u2019s an important decision. To make sure you have all the information you need, could you share what specific aspects you'll be discussing? Whether it\u2019s the budget, functionality, or implementation timeline, I can provide more detailed resources to help guide your internal conversation. How about we schedule a brief follow-up for later this week to address any new questions that come up?",
    "Can you prove the ROI?": "Absolutely. That's a critical question. The return on investment with SecurTime comes from tangible savings in three key areas: reduced payroll leakage, increased productivity through automation, and mitigation of compliance risks. We have a straightforward ROI calculator we can use together. Would you have 20 minutes next week to plug in your own numbers? We can build a custom business case that clearly outlines your potential payback period and long-term savings."
