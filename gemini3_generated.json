  "common_objections": {
    "It's too expensive": "I completely understand that budget is a primary concern. However, we encourage you to view this not just as a software cost, but as risk mitigation. Manual errors, compliance fines from wage-and-hour lawsuits, and 'time theft' often cost companies significantly more than the price of the platform. SecurTime is designed to plug those leaks immediately. Could we schedule a brief consultation to build a custom quote and identify exactly where we can save you money?",
    "We're already using [competitor]": "It is great to hear you are already automating your time and attendance. The reason many organizations switch to ADP SecurTime from other providers is the power of a unified ecosystem. Unlike standalone competitors, SecurTime integrates seamlessly with ADP Payroll, eliminating the data export errors and sync issues that often plague third-party integrations. Would you be open to a 10-minute comparison to see if we can streamline your current workflow further?",
    "We don't have time to implement something new": "I hear you; switching systems can feel like a heavy lift when your team is already at capacity. That is exactly why ADP provides dedicated implementation specialists to handle the heavy lifting and configuration for you, ensuring zero disruption to your current operations. The goal is to give you time back by automating manual tasks immediately after launch. Can I share a sample implementation timeline to show you how minimal the disruption really is?",
    "We need to think about it": "I completely respect that; choosing a workforce management tool is a significant decision. Usually, when clients need more time, it is to weigh specific compliance features or discuss internal adoption. To ensure you have the right data for your internal discussions, are there specific areas of hesitation I can clarify right now? If not, let's schedule a brief check-in next week to address any questions that arise.",
    "Can you prove the ROI?": "That is the most important question to ask. We prove ROI by targeting three specific areas: reducing overtime costs through better visibility, eliminating overpayments caused by manual calculation errors, and lowering administrative hours spent on payroll prep. We can actually run a personalized analysis using your employee count to project your specific savings. Shall we look at those numbers together?"
